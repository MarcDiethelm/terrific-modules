Reusable Terrific.js modules.

## Brainstorm

- Structure of modules is as in classic Terrific (so it's usable as a simple download). (conservative use)
- normal use: `terrific` CLI tool allows automated and customized module "installs"
	- `terrific install accordion --layout xtc`
	- config file to persist options for a target project
- Project needs to be versioned, because there will be some framework-like interdependencies
- modules include tests (using a js-based runner)
- include a overview page/site
- include mini site/server so overview can be run displayed locally.
